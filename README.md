## About this project

I created this project to kickstart your laravel 8 projects with passport for authentication & lighthouse to serve the GraphQL 

### Before starting
Make sure to have some sort of database server running, here i will exemplify using a mysql server


### On the console run:

```
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate
composer install
php artisan serve

```

### Set your database credencials in the .env file:

```
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=mydatabase_name
DB_USERNAME=mydatabase_user
DB_PASSWORD=mydatabase_password

```

### Run the migrations by:
```  
php artisan migrate
```
### Get the passport client secret by runnning on the console:

``` 
php artisan passport:install
```
It will output something like this:

``` 
Encryption keys generated successfully.
Personal access client created successfully.
Client ID: 1
Client secret: JLWoderz1fMpmnGb0hpvniEQe3Q9o5eFPm0hrOa2
Password grant client created successfully.
Client ID: 2
Client secret: zVVIBaxUhN7Pz7BuAp90WoBUYZaRNtqqWyEoES5c
```
Copy the client secret pertaining to the ID:2 
``` 
Client secret: zVVIBaxUhN7Pz7BuAp90WoBUYZaRNtqqWyEoES5c
```
Paste it on the .env file:

``` 
PASSPORT_CLIENT_ID=2
PASSPORT_CLIENT_SECRET=zVVIBaxUhN7Pz7BuAp90WoBUYZaRNtqqWyEoES5c
```

### Run the GraphQL:

First off let's create a user by:

```
php artisan user
```
Start your GraphQL client by going to your localhost and add the playgroud to the url example: 'http://yourlocalhost/graphql-playground'

On the GraphQL client console type the following query:
```
{
  users(first: 1){
    data {
      id
      email
    }
  }
}

```
Et voil√† you should have the query response for the user. 

## Authentication 
### Authentication using GraphqQL

On your project search for the `schema.graphql` file, and change the the query users to:
``` 
users: [User!]! @guard(with: ["api"]) @paginate(type: "paginator" model: "App\\Models\\User")
```

Return to the GraphQL playground and try to execute the same query, you should get an error like this:

``` 
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "Unauthenticated.",
      "extensions": {
        "guards": [
          "api"
        ],
        "category": "authentication"
      },
      etc..
``` 

Meaning that you now need to be authenticated to interact with this query. No Problem! üòâ 
<br>
In the playground open a new tab and execute this mutation:
``` 
mutation {
  login(input: {
    username: "myemail@email.com",
    password: "123456789qq"
  }) {
    access_token
    refresh_token
    expires_in
    token_type
    user {
      id
      email
      name
    }
  }
}
``` 
You‚Äôll get a response with your `access_token` as well as your `refresh_token`.
<br>

Return to the first tab with the users query and on the bottom of the playground interface you'll find the `HTTP HEADERS` section, click it and type:

{
    Authorization : "Bearer YOURTOKEN"
}

Replace `YOURTOKEN` with the access_token that you received on the mutation.

Re-execute the query.

If everything is working, you have your Laravel serving GraphQL as well as an authentication system.
